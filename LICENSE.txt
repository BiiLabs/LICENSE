BiiLabs Software License Terms

BiiLabs BiiTrails

Shape

These license terms are an agreement between you and BiiLabs Co., Ltd. (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any BiiLabs
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are
accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms
apply prospectively and do not alter your or BiiLabs's rights relating to
pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU
HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

General. You may install and use the software and the included BiiLabs
applications solely for internal development, testing and evaluation purposes.

Included BiiLabs Applications. The software includes other BiiLabs
applications which are governed by the licenses embedded in or made available
with those applications.

Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with
separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described
within the software or in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the
software.

Distribution and Production Use Rights.

You may use the software in production (e.g. program the modified or unmodified
software to devices you own or control) and distribute (i.e. make available to
third parties) the modified or unmodified binary image produced from this code.

You may permit your device distributors or developers to copy and distribute the
binary image as programmed or to be programmed to your devices.

You may redistribute the unmodified or modified source to your device
distributors or developers. Modifications must be clearly marked. Any
redistribution in source code form must contain this license and any other
licenses that accompany the software.

Requirements. For any code you distribute, you must:
1. when distributed in binary form, except as embedded in a device, include
   with such distribution the terms of this agreement;
2. when distributed in source code form to distributors or developers of your
   devices, include with such distribution the terms of this agreement; and
3. indemnify, defend and hold harmless BiiLabs from any claims, including
   attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your devices, except
   to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified software.

Restrictions. You may not:
1. remove any copyright notices or licenses contained in the software;
2. use BiiLabs's trademarks or trade dress in your application in any way that
   suggests your device or application comes from or is endorsed by BiiLabs;
3. transfer individual components, specific libraries, classes, functions or code
   fragments of the software separately for purposes unrelated to the software; or
4. use or distribute the software in any way that would subject the software or
   BiiLabs's intellectual property or technology to any other license terms.

SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. BiiLabs reserves all
other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
1. remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of BiiLabs or its suppliers in
   the software;
2. use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate
   malware; or
3. share, publish, distribute, or lease the software, or provide the software as
   a stand-alone offering for others to use.

DATA. This software may interact with other BiiLabs products that collect data
that is transmitted to BiiLabs.

SUPPORT SERVICES. BiiLabs is not obligated under this agreement to provide any
support services for the software. Any support provided is "as is", "with all
faults", and without warranty of any kind.

UPDATES. BiiLabs may periodically update the software. You may obtain updates
only from BiiLabs or BiiLabs-authorized sources. Updates may not include or
support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, BiiLabs may terminate this
agreement if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such
event, you must destroy all copies of the software and all of its component
parts.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms BiiLabs may provide for
supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for
the software. To the extent you have entered into a separate agreement with
BiiLabs relating specifically to the software, the terms in such agreement
shall control.
